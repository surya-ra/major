			CROSS-ORIGIN-XMPL-HTTP-TEQUEST

there is a problem related to the headers. this is known as  "NO-ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW-ORIGIN-HEADER". this header is related to the CORS.  
CAUSE:
while doing an XML Http Request to a different domain than the page is on, the browser blocks it as it usually allows a request in the same origin for security reasons. while using postman they are not restricted by this policy.

CURE:
from google chrome playstore we need to add extension.

CORS:
